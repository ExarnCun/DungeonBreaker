2D Top-down Itembased game

As this game is still in early development nothing really works yet!

this game uses jnativehook for input events : https://github.com/kwhat/jnativehook

to add Jnativehook library in eclipse : 

	1. right-click project

	2. click 'properties'

	3. click 'Java Build Path'

	3.1 goto 'Librarys'-tab (if not alredy there)

	4. click 'Add External JARs...'

	5. browse to this projects folder

	6. select 'jnativehook-2.0.3.jar' (name might be slightly different)

	7. press 'OK'

Maybe the library is alredy added as I tryed to make it's path abstract, but i don't know whether that worked or not.
